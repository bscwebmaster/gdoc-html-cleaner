Usage: `python gdocHtmlCleaner.py google-doc.html > google-doc-clean.html`
Example google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fn-Yoy671f5nw8sSHsDHJohZRlp9zW-K6ZOLCX_R3b8/edit?usp=sharing

The Google doc must be well-formed. Header tags, normal text and so forth. You
will need to go through it carefully and correct things at minimum. Take a
moment to look at the link texts. Are they informative? Can one tell where a
link will take them simply from reading the link text? That's how to do it!

If the document has sections composed of h4 header tags and unordered lists, like
so...

<h4>Member Resources Assistant</h4>
<ul>
  <li>17 hrs./ wk. </li>
  <li>Preference will be given to former house managers. </li>
  <li>Provides support for and assistance to the Member Resources Coordinator in
  their duties. </li>
  <li>Assists in the organization and development of training programs, New
  Member Orientation, and NASCO Institute.</li>
  <li>Provides clerical support and budget monitoring.</li>
</ul>

...it will attempt to turn them into definition lists (<dl>, <dd>, <dt>).

It's a fairly brittle script, and you'll probably have to fix things a bit (or a lot).
